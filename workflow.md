Doing reproducible science means establishing an efficient workflow. 

## Onboarding

There are a few things that each new member should do when he/she joins the research team. These are:

* Create a GitHub account.
* Check that your owncloud account is working.
* We use the slack for communication and wrike for project management. Make sure that you have been invited to both of them. 
* Download and begin to maintain a reference manager. We recommend Zotero, as the free software interfaces well with both Microsoft Word and Google Docs. Download Zotero and browser plugin here.

## Data management

* We generally use a folder called "data" within each repository.
* We keep our raw data in the github repository related to the project, unless the data files are too large.
* We store our raw data with metadata describing whatâ€™s in the file and what the columns mean. We consider this data as read-only.
* If we clean the data, we often use a folder called something like "raw" to differentiate data in its original form from data that has been manipulated.
* If we are using data downloaded from another data source, we include the data source in a README.
* If our data are too large to store on GitHub, we store them in owncloud and include the link to README file for reproducibility.

## Analysis

* We do our data analysis in GitHub repositories to facilitate collaboration and sharing.
* We use scripts to process data, make models, do analyses, etc. and avoid spreedsheets, gis applications or other software.
* We follow some common scripting practices described [here](https://github.com/KVHEM/how_we_work/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Results-Presentation

* We publish git repositories through Zenodo upon publication of a manuscript.
* Collaborative manuscripts are written either in Overleaf or Google Drive.
